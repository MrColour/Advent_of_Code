# Advent_of_Code

Advent of Code is a yearly competition/problem set that begins on the first of December. Each year for the past six years
the Advent of code team have released a two part problem the first 25 days of December. They can actually explain
it much better than me: https://adventofcode.com/2020/about


If you are learning a new language, competing against friends, or brushing rusty skills I would recommend these problems.
They come in all sets and sizes but be prepared to do a bit of parsing. For these problems all you are given are
the problem and oftentimes a big blog of data that you have to change, mangle, and transform into a string that
represents the answer.


To practice and refine my C skills I began doing these problems. They are toy problems but not artificial enough as some other
exercise problems. They have a certain sense of real worldly ness to them. They often follow a story of you saving Christmas that
is also exciting to uncover as you finish each problem.


I learned a lot from doing them. The biggest takeaway was the creation of aoc++.h, a single header include library, that has helped
me a ton, in these problems and in other projects. With each year I completed (completion for me was 90% or more for some years) I distilled
the general things that often popped. I did this with care so as not to create a bloated library. In fact I started out by reading many
standard header files to actually see what does exist. I tried to write code that was somewhere in the middle of readability (for easy debugability),
a bit efficiency, and quickness.


Doing most of them in C made me appreciate how powerful the small functionality of the standard libraries were. Also Year 2020 was done in realtime.
In the others I was doing them at my own pace. But for the year 2020 I had the opportunity to compete, and wait each day for new problems to become available,
so those were optimized more for completion time. I didn't end up making it to the top 100 leaderboard officially, (day one had a server lag and I snatched 42th spot!)
but within the private leaderboard I participated I ended up being first!
