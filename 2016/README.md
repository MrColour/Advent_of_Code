Thanks to the refined aoc++.h library I was able to quickly speed through some of the initial problems.
As last year after I finished all the problems I reread all the solutions and took notes of common
patterns I saw myself doing. One difference however was that I did this starting back again from 2015.
As before reading previous years helps me test the changes I make to the single file include library (I
have more data points!). Due to this I think it took me as much time as last year.

I got 45/50 stars
