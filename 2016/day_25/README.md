This problem isn't decidable through the use of
Turing Machines alone.

Two methods of solving this problem:
	Using general Heuristics, and assumptions about the
input, i.e. that the control flow of the assembunny code is
non-complex and simple, to determine that the output
is good enough, convincing enough, as defined by threshold length.

	Analyzing the assembunny code and being able to isolate
and further prove that the input is non-complex and simple.
Then being able to solve the simple program to show how the input
affects the output in a linear fashion.
