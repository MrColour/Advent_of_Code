I was introduced to Advent of Code on this year. A link made it by my Slack and
I thought the problems were going to be similar to leetcode or other types of exercises.
I was also not prepared to code a mini vm machine. It also seemed that this year took people more
on average (see http://www.maurits.vdschee.nl/scatterplot/) as well but I was trying to do the problems
pretty quickly.

The benefit of this would be that I wold learn from my mistakes and be better prepared to
tackle the previous years.
