I realized a few mistakes I did on 2019 and decided to take on these problems on my own terms.
I had a different mindset when I began doing 2015. I would be doing it to practice problem solving
but also to build up skills to help be solve problems, better and faster.

The optimal path for this would be to build a useful C library. But in order to not have redundancies
I read the functions that the standard C header files declared and got familiar with them. This was
beneficial as in 2019 I did not use as many standard functions. I wanted an easy way to include my
library so I made it a single file header include type. Some of the functions I defined would end up becoming
ones I would reuse throughout my practice session of the years 2015-2018. I tried to make the functionality powerful
but flexible as well (some of this is achieved through using a similar pattern to the C sorting functions quicksort).
After having finished a year to my satisfaction I would reread all my solutions taking notes of common patterns.
Furthermore, rereading them allowed me two things, refactor the code, and serve as a testing ground to the new changes I
would make to the header include library.

I got 44/50 stars
