The program would take to long to run.
I did however notice that every 15k the lines would repeat.
In the most likely case, they repeat sooner, meaning the modulo needed can
be more tight.

Would be interesting to optimize this program without that trick however.
There may be some clever ways to reduce the operations or how the commands
change the order of the programs. Would have to see what other people did.
