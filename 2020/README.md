This year was done in real time. Each day at Midnight UTC-5 a new problem set was added.
Due to this I this year is a mixture between C and python code.

I made a program that would auto-initialize each day with two Python files and two C files.
From there I read the problem and choose whichever language I was most comfortable writing a solution in.
This year I did all 25 problems.
