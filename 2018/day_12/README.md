Part two might need to be redone. It uses an assumption
that was found by printing out each line up to 300 lines.

The problem however is that such a finding in some other problems
would not be possible. Normally this would not be computable depending on the
problem, of which this one seemed like one, see automaton Rule 30.
Most likely however because this is a puzzle it was made, or reverse
engineered, such that it would lead to repetitive cycle.

Would have to see what other people did. Doesn't seem like
there are shortcuts that can be taken.
