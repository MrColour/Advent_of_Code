At this point might as well code up an entire game.
Come back to this one later, maybe there will be tricks up my sleeve.
Or maybe steal tricks up someone elses sleeve, wonder what shortcuts
other people may have taken for this problem.

Seems simple enough, but very prone to many bugs,
and quite lengthy, to code in C nonetheless.
